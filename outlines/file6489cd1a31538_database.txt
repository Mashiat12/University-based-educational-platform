1.Introduction: Provides an overview of the concepts, applications, and evolution of DBMS. Covers data abstraction, data independence, schema and instances, and the concepts of DDL, DML, and DCL.

2.Data Models: Discusses different data models such as the E-R model and alternate data models like hierarchical, network, and graph models. Covers entities, relationships, attributes, keys, and E-R diagram.

3.Relational Languages and Relational Model: Introduces SQL (Structured Query Language), its features, and usage for queries and sub-queries. Covers set operations, relations, views, relational algebra, and database modification. Also mentions QBE (Query by Example) and domain relational calculus.

4.Database Constraints and Normalization: Covers integrity constraints, domain constraints, assertions, triggering, functional dependencies, and different normal forms like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, BCNF, and DKNF.

5.Query Processing and Optimization: Discusses query cost estimation, query operations, evaluation of expressions, query optimization, query decomposition, and performance tuning.

6.File Structure and Hashing: Covers different file organizations, disk storage, remote backup systems, hashing concepts (static and dynamic), order indices, and B+ tree index.

7.Transactions Processing and Concurrency Control: Introduces ACID properties, concurrent executions, serializability concept, lock-based protocols, deadlock handling, and prevention.

8.Crash Recovery: Discusses failure classification, recovery and atomicity, log-based recovery, shadow paging, and advanced recovery techniques.

9.Advanced Database Concepts: Covers object-oriented and distributed database models, properties of parallel and distributed databases, data warehouse databases, and spatial databases.

10.Practical: Includes hands-on practice with a specific DBMS (such as MS-Access or MySQL) for tasks like installation, configuration, SQL commands, DML commands, DDL commands, procedures/triggers, database administration, and working with other databases.

11.Group Project Development: Involves working on a group project related to database management.

12.Project Presentation and Viva: Concludes the course with project presentations and viva voce.

13.This course outline provides a comprehensive overview of the topics and objectives that will be covered in a DBMS course. It covers various aspects of database management, including data modeling, query languages, normalization, file organization, transactions, recovery, and advanced concepts. The practical component allows students to gain hands-on experience with a specific DBMS and work on a group project to apply their knowledge.
